# Tiny Summit

If Titan got such a cool little brother, "Tiny Titan",
 why can't Summit have Tiny Summit?

## Design Specifications

This project is meant to display the use of water cooling in HPC. All prototypes should keep the following componants visible:
 * 8 NVIDIA Jetson TX2s (with LEDs on front)
 * 1 water reservoir of undecided size with attached radiator (essentially a box)
 * Pipage to connect Jetson and resevoir

Other components include
 * 1 Raspberry Pi Model 3
 * 10 or 16 port Network Switch
 * Ethernet cables
 * Power supplies for Jetsons, Raspberry Pi, Radiator, and Switch
